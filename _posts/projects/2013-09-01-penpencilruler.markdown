Pen Pencil Ruler was a website where students could type up their revision notes (full length or short jottings) which are then sorted into subjects and topics to make notes easier to find. Since revision notes need to be accessed wherever a student is, Pen Pencil Ruler uses a web interface.

Pen Pencil Ruler went live from the end of August 2013 and ran for two months. I have written a [blog post](/blog/penpencilruler-status/) about Pen Pencil Ruler.

The site is no longer live, but the source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/jackhughesweb/penpencilruler).
