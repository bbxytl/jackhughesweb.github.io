PrettyRoute is a route planner to find you the most scenic route. The webapp takes your from and to points, and a list of preferred types of places to visit on the way.

PrettyRoute displays your recommended route, with a list of places to visit and links to find out more. There is also a button to generate a new route.

I created PrettyRoute for YRS Festival of Code 2015 ([blog post](/blog/yrs2015/)) with my group [Team Screaming Square Dinosaur](https://github.com/teamscreamingsquaredinosaur). PrettyRoute reached the semi-final for Should Exist.

PrettyRoute is currently live at [prettyroute.xyz](https://prettyroute.xyz) and the source code is currently on [GitHub](https://github.com/teamscreamingsquaredinosaur/prettyroute).
