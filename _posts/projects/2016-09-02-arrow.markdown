Arrow is an unofficial companion to [Quiver](https://github.com/HappenApps/Quiver/wiki/Quiver-Data-Format) for Mac, for reading libraries and notebooks on iOS devices. The app features Dropbox syncing and offline support, for reading without a network connection, as well as rendering Markdown notes and LaTeX equations.

The app uses a number of [open source libraries](/projects/arrow/credits/).
