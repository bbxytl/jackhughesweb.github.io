ExploreLocal is a game for discovering and identifying nearby places of interest. Players are presented with clues from sources such as Wikipedia and Flickr and they then have to guess where the place is.

Points are gained from accurately choosing the correct location and points are deducted for using more clues. At the end of the game, players receive an award and have the option of challenging their friends using social media.

I created ExploreLocal for YRS Festival of Code 2014,  which I wrote a [blog post](/blog/yrs2014/) about. ExploreLocal reached the semi-final for Best in Show.

ExploreLocal is currently live at [explore.jackhughesweb.com](http://explore.jackhughesweb.com) and the source code is currently on [GitHub](https://github.com/jackhughesweb/explorelocal).
