A script for finding Day One entries that don't yet have a photo attached, but a photo was taken on the day of the entry and could be attached to it. The script obtains photos from the Camera Uploads folder used by Dropbox's Carousel.

Designed to be used with OSX, however the paths can be adapted to work with other platforms.

The source code is currently on [GitHub](https://github.com/jackhughesweb/dayonecarousel).
