So you're chatting in Slack, and there's a new xkcd out. Your RSS reader isn't open, and you haven't looked at xkcd.com in a while. With this bot for Slack, don't worry about missing out, as it'll post the latest xkcd to Slack automagically* (*depending on the cron job that you use).

The source code is currently on [GitHub](https://github.com/jackhughesweb/new-xkcd-slack).
