Whenever I get a new, shiny device, the first thing I do is download apps. And *more apps* and *more apps* until I can’t download any more.

* * *

There are millions of apps on device stores. *Millions*.

Do you need an app for talking to friends? There’s an app for that.

Do you need an app for taking photos? There’s an app for that.

Do you need an app to tell you the latest travel information? There’s an app for that.

Do you need an app to read the news? There’s an app for that.

* * *

There are lots of apps available — except *one*:

An app for **focusing**. To turn off distractions. To ignore notifications. To **focus on tasks**.

It’s not easy to concentrate with the endless amounts of apps on our devices, but the next time you are trying to keep on task — try to delay replying to that tweet, reading that newsletter or catching up on your RSS feeds. Try to turn your app-filled device **off**.
