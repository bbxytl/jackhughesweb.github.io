You probably don't own a journal. You'll think back to a moment in your life, but your idea of it is a bit sketchy. You'll have heard of journals, but only of a professor's journal or a girl's diary.

Imagine that you could look back at mistakes you have made and you could improve on them. You could read every one of your thoughts which you've ever had. You had every moment of your **whole life**, sitting in front of you.

A journal is one of the most important items that a person owns. It contains your ideas, your experiences, your life. You can  look back to see what you have done, places you have visited, people you have met and discoveries you have made.

A journal allows you to reflect on your life. To change how you behave.

And yes, there'll be *those people* who will laugh about you writing in a journal. But ignore them. Because you have a **journal**.

So get a journal, digital or physical, and **just write**.
