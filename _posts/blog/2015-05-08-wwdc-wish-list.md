WWDC15, “the epicenter of change”, is approaching. Here are some thoughts and wishes that I have for this year's event:

# iOS 9 Features

### Today

Today would merge both the Today View and Notification Center. The widgets in Today View are too cramped and I don’t often look at them. Notification Center often takes the centre stage and overshadows the Today View. 

The new merged Today is would still be a swipe down from the top of the screen, opening to a home view similar to the current Today View. However, there are settings available to choose which apps are used to source the displayed weather and reminders. The view could also show you recent emails and notifications. This home view would feature only small widgets. 

Today could feature separate panes for full-screen widgets: such as a pane to quickly add reminders to Wunderlist, to show the weather from Dark Sky or a calendar pane for Sunrise.

Today would show me a quick glance of what is going on now, without having to dive into different productivity and utility apps.

### Quick Reply

Quick Reply is currently used by Messages.app, to send a reply to a message from a notification. This saves me from needlessly switching away from the app I’m using. Quick Reply should be opened up by Apple to third party developers to add into other messaging apps too.

### Default Apps

I have found myself using many third party apps instead of Apple’s own built in apps. It would make sense to choose default apps to replace Apple’s apps for tasks (e.g. emails, calendars and web browsing), overriding default actions. 

Enabling this would allow apps, such as Chrome, to open web URLs, and Mailbox to open mailto: links (in a extension-style compose view). 

Apple could also remove the default Twitter and Facebook compose views, and give apps control over the view to provide familiar branding and features from the app.

Default apps should integrate with Siri. Asking Siri to “remind me to phone work” would create a new reminder in Wunderlist. 
However some apps may not support “remind me to … when I get home”, therefore apps would need to declare what they are capable of using a new Siri API.

And maybe, just maybe, Apple could *finally* allow me to hide the pre-installed apps from my home screen.

### Apple Pay in the UK

Not a new feature, but I’m waiting for this to arrive in the UK.

# iOS 9 Fixes

### iTunes WiFi Sync

My iOS devices rarely see my Mac over Wi-Fi and I’d like to avoid having to connect devices over USB to sync, so having iTunes Wi-Fi sync work would be useful.

### The ‘(2)’ Bug

iTunes is causing my iOS devices to add ‘(2)’ to the end of their names when they sync. I still don’t know what is causing this (if you know of a fix, please email me).

### YouTube

Attempting to use YouTube in iOS Safari is complicated: 

1. Visiting “youtube.com” in Safari, causes the YouTube app to open

2. I then close the YouTube app and return to Safari

3. Going back to “youtube.com”, Safari asks if I’d like to open the app 

4. Pressing “cancel”, takes me to a blank page

5. On the third attempt to go to “youtube.com”, the page finally loads

Apple and YouTube should fix this by loading “youtube.com” as expected and giving the user a deep link into the app if they would like to use it.

# Mac OS 10.11

After Yosemite’s new design and features, I’m hoping that OS 10.11 will bring a performance update and the bug fixes that OS 10.10 (Yosemite) was missing.

However, the recent complaints from developers about Yosemite suggest that if Apple includes any new unnecessary or buggy features in OS X, then it would be wise to name 10.11 "OS X Death Valley".

# The Epicenter of Change

I'm excited to see what's in store at this year's WWDC, with iOS, Mac OSX and Watch OS. Apple has something that they are wanting to share, and I think it's going to be a big change.
