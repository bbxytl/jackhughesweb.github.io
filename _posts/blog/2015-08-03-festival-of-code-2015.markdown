Last week, I went to YRS Festival of Code 2015. This year was my second, and final, year of taking part.

During the week, I went to my local centre (Barclays Tech Bar Birmingham) to work on a hack that uses open data. I worked with my team, [Team Screaming Square Dinosaur](https://github.com/teamscreamingsquaredinosaur), to create our hack [PrettyRoute](https://prettyroute.xyz) (our [source code is on GitHub](https://github.com/teamscreamingsquaredinosaur/prettyroute)).

We created PrettyRoute for tourists going on road journeys, so that they could discover places on their journey and make their journey much more interesting. It uses an algorithm which finds places of interest near to your route, and finds a route through the found places.

The team worked on the project from Monday to Thursday, before attending a Show and Tell session at BBC Birmingham. We were given valuable feedback, looked at other hacks and ate pizza.

On Friday, we finished off PrettyRoute, before heading to the the ICC for the weekend. The team then spent Friday night fixing bugs, eating pizza and panicking over merge conflicts.

On Saturday, we presented our hack in the heats. PrettyRoute got through to the semi-finals, but we didn't make it through to the finals.

On Sunday, we watched the finals. The quality of the projects were high and the judges had a hard time choosing winners. Since this year is the last time I could participate, I was welcomed onto the stage with other YRSers who are too old to take part next year.

After the finals, we all departed.

Over the weekend, I caught up with people I met from last year (and was shown a [pretty cool project](http://matthewwellings.com/rippletank/) by a Rewired State member), closed as many GitHub issues as I could, and wrote many many many lines of code.

The Festival of Code has enabled me to meet new people, create awesome projects and work with open data. I can't say thank you enough to the staff, volunteers, center leads, mentors and everyone else at YRS for the festival. It's truly incredible - the whole community is just amazing!

I can't participate next year, but I'm definitely going to mentork instead.
