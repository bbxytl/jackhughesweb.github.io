Firstly, for those who haven’t heard of PenPencilRuler.com, it is a website where students could type up their revision notes (full length or short jottings) which are then sorted into subjects and topics to make notes easier to find. (The other main features of PPR were that you were less likely to lose your notes and all notes were private)

## Before PenPencilRuler.com

Prior to PenPencilRuler.com, I knew HTML, CSS (SASS), JavaScript and PHP. I really wanted to try to learn Ruby on Rails at the time and PPR seemed perfect for learning it. It took a while to start the project because of the steep learning curve, but after a couple of weeks I had a private GitHub repo setup which I was contributing to almost daily. I was enjoying it so much. I started by creating a bare-bones website and I then would add features on after that.

Since PPR was my first project, I was more interested in building than researching user needs – I just wanted to start a new project because the thought of starting a new project sounded exciting to me. Not looking into the user’s needs was fatal. Instead, I just focused on my needs for revision because I carelessly assumed that my needs were the same as everyone else who were in education.

## The Launch

I continued on adding features such as search and tweaking the design of pages, however I was never happy with the overall design of the pages.

On the 25th August 2013, I launched PenPencilRuler.com. For the first week, the admin dashboard (which I created with Twitter Bootstrap) displayed the same number of users: 1. I was the only user. I hadn’t created much of a hype before the launch. I just released it as soon as I got the server to work (thanks to a Railscast).

To attract users, I mentioned it on Twitter and one of my followers had signed up. I used Facebook to advertise which bought in about five users and I received 40 clicks. I had wasted my own money on unsuccessful advertising.

## Later on…

Two months later (October 2013), I had added a few more features, setup the database to backup to Amazon S3 and fixed many server problems. I had learnt a lot over the last few months. Originally I had planned to add subscriptions to PPR but nobody was using their accounts, so it would not have been worth it.

I had to decide whether to continue running and developing PPR. I ran another (also unsuccessful) Facebook campaign. Today I have made the final decision of closing down PenPencilRuler.com. It is heartbreaking for me to close it because I spent so much of my time working on it, but nobody was going to use it anyway. The website relied on people who revised by only reading, not by creating visual or auditory things. The website was basically flawed from the start, but I had not realised it since I was stuck in a bubble thinking about the fame and glory because I had seen how successful many startups are.

## My Thoughts

From the past few months, I would tell people who are starting their first project to plan each step of the project – have a plan for development and design, know what you are researching and make sure that you know how you are going to market your product/service. You will feel awesome for creating something, even if some people poke fun at what you have made.

Go ahead. Start now.
