My bus usually arrives when it pleases. It never sticks to the schedule. So I wait in the bus shelter — the one which smells of urine, has empty bottles of beer, a burnt bin and a noticeboard on its last legs. Lovely.

The bus is quiet, cold and empty. Icicles hang from the ceiling,  and a breeze blows through the bus. I look around to find that all of the windows are open. The driver looks at me expressionless and the passengers watch me as I find my seat. They listen into my conversation. 

The bus makes it way around the route, stopping occasionally. I reach my destination with numb, white hands. I thank the bus driver and leave the bus.

The bus isn't always cold and quiet. In fact, it's often the opposite:

The bus pulls up, moderately full. Passengers pile on the bus, filling every seat. I manage to squeeze my way onto the bus to be greeted yet again by an expressionless driver. The passengers continue to pile on. And on. And on. 

Until the driver says “stop!”. By then, people are packed onto the bus like a tin of sardines. Faces pressed against the windows. No room for movement. 

Don't even think about getting off, because you can't. ‘Cosy’ cannot even begin to describe these conditions on the bus.

If I get a seat, it's a lucky day — because you really don't want to stand on these buses. You are thrown around, tripping and falling at every stop.

The bus will often stop and when the doors open, the build up of pressure is released and passengers spew out onto the pavement.

The sheer number of people on the bus heats up the bus, along with the heaters which are on full blast. I don't bother to open the windows though, because I won't succeed. That's because the driver has lined each window with superglue for his own enjoyment.

On a wet day, the windows steam up. There is only one solution to prevent this: turning the heating up to max. The bus is unbearable like this.

And then the bus hits busy traffic. It crawls down the busy road, stopping and starting. Inching forward until it just touches the bumper of the car in front.

After rush hour, the bus is quiet again. There still are lots of passengers, but nobody is standing. Nobody dares to make eye contact. Nobody is talking. At this point, people grab their earphones to listen to music. It's as though the bus has transformed into the Tube mid-journey.

These nightmarish bus journeys always make reaching my destination feel great.
