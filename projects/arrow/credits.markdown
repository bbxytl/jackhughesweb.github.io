[Arrow](/projects/arrow/) was made by [Jack Hughes](http://jackhughesweb.com) as a way to read [Quiver](https://github.com/HappenApps/Quiver/wiki/Quiver-Data-Format) libraries and notebooks on iOS devices.

The most recent version of this app (v1.0.1) uses SwiftyDropbox, LTMarkdownParser, MMMarkdown, Regex, ReachabilitySwift, MBProgressHUD, MathJax, and Highlight.js.

For older versions, [view the history of this page on GitHub](https://github.com/jackhughesweb/jackhughesweb.github.io/blob/master/projects/arrow/credits.markdown).
